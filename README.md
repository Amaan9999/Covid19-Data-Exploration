# Covid19-Data-Exploration
In this project, I utilised SQL to perform Data Exploration using Covid19 datasets to gain helpful insights and perform calculations. This will involve using various skills such as: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types. In the next part of this project I created a dashboard in Tableau.
